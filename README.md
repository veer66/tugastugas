# Tugastugas

Tugastugas is a showcase task manager.

A showcase for:

* GraphQL
* Graphene
* SQLAlchemy
* PostgreSQL


## Objective

* Showing off what I'm capable of in web-backend.
* Updating my skills and knowledge in relatively new technologies, e.g., GraphQL.
* Refreshing my knowledge about new versions of tools, e.g., SQLAlchemy 2.x.

## Design Rationale

* I'm avoiding SQL 2011 temporal functionality in this project because using the temporal_tables extension isn't feasible with Amazon Aurora.

## Usage examples

The following examples are accessing GraphAPI API via cURL command line. 
However, using a graphical client, e.g. [Altair](https://altairgraphql.dev/) is much more convenient.

### Retrieve tasks

### Filter tasks

### Create a task

### Update a task

### Delete a task
